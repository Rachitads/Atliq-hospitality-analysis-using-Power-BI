Revenue Insights for Hospitality Management of AtliQ Grands




PROBLEM STATEMENT

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.

Objective: To provide AtliQ Grands with insights from their historical data to regain their market share and revenue.

This project was created using Microsoft Power BI including the following:

· Multiple complex DAX formulas and Functions

· Calculated columns

· Data Extraction, Cleaning, and Transformation (ETL)

· Data Modelling

· Data Visualization

· Data Analysis


For AtliQ Grands Hotel, the data analysis carried out with Power BI has given important insights into a number of elements of hotel administration. The research's conclusions and suggestions can help businesses run more efficiently, satisfy customers better, and increase sales. The hotel will continue to succeed if important metrics are regularly monitored and analysed. 



INSIGHTS 

* In the three months of May, June, and July, AtliQ Grands was able to bring in about 1.7 billion in income. Except for realisation% , all other metrics during this time period grew from the most recent prior week: revenue, ADR, occupancy, and revpar.

* 3.62 is the total average rating. With an average rating rise of 1.27% over the last three months, customer satisfaction has increased. Despite the fact that some hotels have ratings that are below average.

* Weekday occupancy rates are consistently lower than those of the weekends. Weekend and weekday ADR are not significantly different from one another. This demonstrates the hotel's use of a flat price approach.

* With 40% of all bookings and income coming from other travel platforms/channels, these are the main sources of reservations. The direct offline booking method makes around 5% of all bookings and revenue.

* In comparison to other booking platforms, the Average Daily (ADR) Rate is greater on direct offline (hotel premises).

* The majority of sales and reservations come from the category of luxury rooms. The largest income contributor is the city of Mumbai, followed by Hyderabad, Bangalore, and Delhi.


Suggestions:

* The hotel should use dynamic pricing to raise prices during busy times and on weekends and improve revenue creation.

* Can consider using targeted marketing campaigns and promotions to encourage bookings on their offline booking platforms in order to adopt differential pricing techniques. This will boost income.

* AtliQ Grands can pay more attention to client feedback and ratings and concentrate on enhancing customer happiness by resolving pressing issues raised in customer feedback.

* sould investigate ways to boost direct reservations made through the hotel's website to decrease reliance on other online channels.
